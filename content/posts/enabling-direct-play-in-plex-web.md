# Enabling direct play in Plex

Enabling direct play is advisable for all Plex streams, when you lower the quality in your client, the Plex server has to calculate the difference and convert the original file to a lower quality version--this process is called Transcoding. Netflix does this with millions of dollars and server farms, for the poor old Plex server, avoiding transcoding will ensure the CPU of the server doesn't cry too much.

I'm attaching a few images that contain steps for a few clients, to enable maximum quality online streaming, which will prevent unnecessary transcoding, and a better quality video on the device.

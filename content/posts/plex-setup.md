In this guide, we'll run through the first steps to take when accessing Plex.

So you've now got a Plex account, and have been invited to the server. A few things to know, you have made an account with Plex, a software company, and I share content on my server with your Plex account. After first signing in, make sure to pin the sources to your sidebar, so your homescreen is populated with all the great content available, [read more here <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://support.plex.tv/articles/customizing-plex-web/)

When you're happy with how it looks, change your password! The one I provide should be temporary.

There are Plex apps for almost every device, so you can enjoy it on your TV directly, PS4 etc.

There is a lot of recommendations and genre organising inside each library type, so check it out if you're struggling to find something. If somethings missing and you really want to watch it, get access to the Signal group by asking whoever invited you, and you can add recommendations there.

Enabling direct play is advisable for all Plex streams, when you lower the quality in your client, the Plex server has to calculate the difference and convert the original file to a lower quality version--this process is called [_transcoding_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding). Netflix does this with millions of dollars and server farms, for the poor old Plex server, avoiding [_transcoding_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding) will ensure the CPU of the server doesn't cry too much.

I'm attaching a few images that contain steps for a few clients, to enable maximum quality online streaming, which will prevent unnecessary [_transcoding_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding), and a better quality video on the device.

I can't promise any greater uptime, or that your requests will come in quicker, but if you've enjoyed the service for its lifetime (over 1 year now), you may consider donating.

Here's a breakdown of what things cost, firstly to make the content available for viewing on Plex, and secondly the ability to continue downloading new content for our viewing pleasure.

```bash
    - Storage costs: $32/mo
    - Usenet indexer: $18/6mo
    - Usenet unlimited access downloads: $9/mo
    - Varied usenet block accounts: $40/yr
```

I will continue to provide the service for free to invited friends, and there's no obligation or requirement moving forward for any payment at all, but if you've enjoyed the access at all and can afford to spare a few bucks every now and then to help out with the ongoing costs, you'll be contributing to [poopernetplex](https://plex.pooper.net.au)'s ongoing life.

Only contribute if you can afford to,  
There is no requirement to,  
This is a donation not a subscription,  
This is not Netflix,  
You can still request things via Signal,  
Sir this is a McDonalds.

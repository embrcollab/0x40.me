## Hey

If you like what I do with poopernetplex ([https://plex.pooper.net.au](https://plex.pooper.net.au)), please consider reading on,

---

I can't promise any greater uptime, or that your requests will come in quicker, but if you've enjoyed the service for its lifetime (over 1 year now), you may consider donating.

Here's a breakdown of what things cost, firstly to make the content available for viewing on Plex, and secondly the ability to continue downloading new content for our viewing pleasure.

```bash
    - Storage costs: $32/mo
    - Usenet indexer: $18/6mo
    - Usenet unlimited access downloads: $9/mo
    - Varied usenet block accounts: $40/yr
```

I will continue to provide the service for free to invited friends, and there's no obligation or requirement moving forward for any payment at all, but if you've enjoyed the access at all and can afford to spare a few bucks every now and then to help out with the ongoing costs, you'll be contributing to [poopernetplex](https://plex.pooper.net.au)'s ongoing life.

Only contribute if you can afford to,  
There is no requirement to,  
This is a donation not a subscription,  
This is not Netflix,  
You can still request things via Signal,  
Sir this is a McDonalds.

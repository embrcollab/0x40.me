## Profile

My experience is varied however I have found myself enjoying challenging tasks, whether it be maintaining the balance between the customer-business relationship or following specific criteria to design and create real world solutions to problems. I believe if I run into a problem, I can find a way to work through it in the most efficient and productive way.

## Expertise and software experience

  - Network fundementals

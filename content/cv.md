## This is currently out of date and hasn't been updated in a while. 

## Profile

My experience is varied however I have found myself enjoying challenging tasks, whether it be maintaining the balance between the customer-business relationship or following specific criteria to design and create real world solutions to problems. I believe if I run into a problem, I can find a way to work through it in the most efficient and productive way.

## Expertise and software experience

I've been working as a L1/L2 Technical Support and Server Administrator for 18 months. During this role I have developed skills specific to a Linux based web hosting and domains company. During my tenure in this role, I have been exposed to the following technologies.

  - MySQL (MariaDB)
  - Network fundementals
  - Web servers including NGINX, Apache and LiteSpeed
  - Web languages including HTML, PHP and CSS

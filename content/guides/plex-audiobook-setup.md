{{< /lead >}}

I have created an exclusive audibook library, Plex apps do not play long form audio very well at all, some community members have made a few native phone applications that provide a top class audiobook and podcast listening experience. This guide will have steps showing the setup process across both platforms (Android, iOS).

# Pre-requisites

1. You must be invited to the Audiobook library by me first
2. Download the appropriate application for your device. Chronicle for Android, Prologue for iOS

### _Android:_
[Download Chronicle here <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.mattpvaughn.chronicle&hl=en_GB)


### _iOS:_
[Download Prologue here <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prologue/id1459223267)


# iOS Setup

1. After downloading the App, open it and sign in, Selecting the right Plex home user if you need to (I don't think you will need to.)
